Further, if we do not pass on the reduced interest rates to our borrowers, it may result in some of the borrowers prepaying the loan to take advantage of the reduced interest rate environment, thereby impacting our growth and profitability. If interest rates rise, some or all of our lenders may increase the interest rates at which we borrow resulting in an increase in our effective cost of funds. We may or may not be able to pass on the increased interest rates to our borrowers simultaneously with the increase in our borrowing rates, or at all, thereby affecting our net interest income and we may find it difficult to compete with our competitors, who may have access to low-cost funds or lower cost deposits.

Additionally, most of our financing agreements also contain cross- default and cross-acceleration clauses, which are triggered in the event of default by our Company under the respective financing agreements. We also entered into a debenture subscription agreement and a debenture trust deed each dated December 28, 2023 in relation to our issuance of non-convertible debentures, pursuant to which an event of default would be triggered if our Company does not comply with, inter alia, the specified use of the subscription proceeds or a set of safeguards and social requirements designated by the subscriber of the non-convertible debentures.

For instance, under the Master Directions on Loan Exposures, transfer of loans not in default can be made to permitted transferees through novation, assignment or loan participation contracts, only on a cash basis and the consideration must be received not later than at the time of the transfer of the loans. Loans can only be transferred after a minimum holding period (\u201cMHP\u201d), as counted from the date of registration of the underlying security interest with CERSAI, i.e., (a) three months in case of loans with tenor of up to two years; (b) six months in case of loans with tenor of more than two years.

Property records in India are maintained at the state/ district/ local sub-registrar level and in local languages and are updated manually through physical records. Therefore, property records may not be available online for inspection, may be illegible, untraceable, tampered and incomplete, may not have been updated regularly, may be inaccurate in certain respects or may have been kept in poor condition which may impede title investigations or our ability to rely on such property records. Title to land in India is often fragmented, and in many cases, land may have multiple owners. Title may also suffer from irregularities, such as non-execution or non-registration of conveyance/title deeds and inadequate stamping and may be subjected to encumbrances that we are unaware of and that may not be apparent on the face of the relevant documentation. Any defects in, or irregularities of, title may result in a loss of development or operating rights over the land, which may prejudice our ability to realize the loan amount extended to our customers in case of a default in payment. This will compel us to write off such loans or litigate the cases with a heavy cost and an indefinite time to resolution, which will adversely affect our revenues.\n\nWe undertake a property search/ non-encumbrance report/ certificate for all the cases from the empaneled advocates prior to disbursement of the loans and to check that the title to the property is clear and marketable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb7eff21-5afb-4eaf-a964-d347de1aa638": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb7eff21-5afb-4eaf-a964-d347de1aa638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Furthermore, there is no mechanism to verify multiple executions on the same day with different registrars or to verify the legitimacy of such executions.

Secondly, any deed if registered is a public document and is easily accessible from the sub registrar by any third party to mutilate the title of the property.\n\nThe Government set up the Central Registry of Securitization Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (\u201cCERSAI\u201d) under SARFAESI in April 2011 to have a central database of all mortgages created by lending institutions; all banks and HFCs which fall under the range of SARFAESI are required to register with CERSAI and submit the data in respect of all properties mortgaged in their favor. However, the avoidance of duplicated application by cross-checking on CERSAI is subject to the accuracy of descriptions of property submitted by borrowers and highlighted in the deeds of sale. In all cases, we verify online CERSAI data before disbursement.\n\nAs a result, potential disputes or claims over title to our mortgaged properties may arise. However, an adverse decision from a court or the absence of an agreement with such third parties may result in additional costs and delays in the realization of the loan amount.

Any decision of the committee of creditors must be taken by a vote of not less than 75% of the voting share of all financial creditors. Any resolution plan approved by committee of creditors is binding upon all creditors, even if they vote against it. For instance, insolvency proceedings were instituted against a customer of our Company (the \u201cCorporate Debtor\u201d) by its financial creditors in October 2020 for allegedly committing default in respect of certain units of a project (\u201cProject\u201d) being developed by the Corporate Debtor and purchased by its creditors.

Before sale proceeds are distributed to a secured creditor, they are to be distributed for the costs of the insolvency resolution and liquidation processes and debts owed to workmen and other employees. Further, under this process, dues owed to the Central and State Governments rank below the claims of secured creditors, workmen and other employee dues and unsecured financial creditors.

The growth rate of India\u2019s housing finance industry may not be sustainable.\n\nThe Government of India has been pursuing various social welfare schemes and initiatives to create an enabling and supportive environment to both enhance the flow of credit to the housing sector and increase home ownership in India. Various Central Government policies and initiatives such as \"Smart Cities\" and the \"Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana\" or the \"Housing for all by 2022\" scheme have reinforced the primacy of the housing sector and the need to provide housing to all and are expected to promote the low income housing segment through partnerships with private sector entities. However, it is not clear how certain trends and events, such as the impact of COVID-19 on the economy the pace of India's economic growth, the development of domestic capital markets and the ongoing reform will affect India's housing finance industry. In addition, there can be no assurance that the housing finance industry in India is free from systemic risks. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the growth and development of India's housing finance industry will be sustainable. Any slowdown or reversal of the growth of India's housing finance industry may affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n2. The Indian housing finance industry is highly competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively, it could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in India and we compete with banks, other HFCs focused on low income housing segment, HFCs, small finance banks and NBFCs in each of the geographies in which we operate. Our competitors may have more resources, a wider branch and distribution network, access to cheaper funding, superior technology and may have a better understanding of and relationships with customers in these markets. This may make it easier for competitors to expand and to achieve economies of scale to a greater extent. In addition, our competitors may be able to rely on the reach of the retail presence of their affiliated group companies or banks. Competition in this market segment has also increased as a result of interest rate deregulation and other liberalization measures affecting the housing finance industry in India and we expect competition to intensify in the future.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cda283c0-8103-4caa-8d28-2f093df8fe36": {"__data__": {"id_": "cda283c0-8103-4caa-8d28-2f093df8fe36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain or increase our margins. Our margins are affected in part by our ability to continue to secure low-cost capital, and to charge optimum interest rates when lending to our customers. Consequently, our ability to maintain or increase our margins will be dependent on our ability to pass on increases in the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities to our customers. Moreover, any increases in the interest rates on the loans we extend may also result in a decrease in business. For instance, we increased RPLR by 50 BPS during the month of October 2022 and 75 BPS in April 2023 to compensate for increase in finance cost on borrowing in FY2023 and FY2024. This has resulted in an increase in our finance cost for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and the partial impact on our finance cost is expected to set in the fourth quarter of FY2024 which may impact the spread earned by us. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Significant Factors Affecting our Results of Operations \u2013 Our ability to maintain our net interest income and net interest margin\u201d on page 340 for further details. We cannot assure you that we will be able to react effectively to these or other market developments or compete effectively with new and existing players in the increasingly competitive housing finance industry. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nFurther, our well-performing loans are liable to be taken over by competitors at low rate as there is no penalty on the pre- closure of floating rate loans. Floating rate loans account for a majority of our loans. If many customers choose to transfer their loans to other institution, it may make it difficult for us to grow our portfolio.\n\n3.

India's existing credit information infrastructure may pose problems and difficulties in running a robust credit check on our borrowers. We may also face difficulties in the due diligence process relating to our customers or to any security or collateral we take in relation to our loans. We may not be able to run comprehensive searches relating to the security and there are no assurances that any searches we undertake will be accurate or reliable. Hence, our overall credit analysis could be less robust as compared to similar transactions in more developed economies, which might result in an increase in our NPAs and we may have to increase our provisions correspondingly. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n2.

Financial instability in other countries may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets.\n\nThe Indian market and the Indian economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries, particularly emerging market countries in Asia. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investors' reactions to developments in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies in other countries, including India. A loss of investor confidence in the financial systems of other emerging markets may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets and, indirectly, in the Indian economy in general. Any worldwide financial instability could also have a negative impact on the Indian economy. Financial disruptions may occur again and could harm our business, our future financial performance and the prices of the Equity Shares.\n\nIf inflation were to rise in India, we might not be able to increase the prices of our services at a proportional rate in order to pass costs on to our customers and our profits might decline.\n\nInflation rates could be volatile, and we may face high inflation in the future as India had witnessed in the past.

To meet future capital requirements towards onward lending\n\nWe are a housing finance company in India and are registered with the NHB and are a notified financial institution under the SARFAESI Act. We focus on providing low income housing finance products for the economically weaker sections and lower income segments in India and cater to both salaried and self-employed borrowers. For details, see \u201cOur Business\u201d on page 151.\n\nAs per the RBI Master Directions \u2013 HFC, we are required to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio, consisting of Tier I capital and Tier II capital of not less than 15% of our aggregate risk weighted assets and risk adjusted value of off-balance sheet items with Tier-I capital not below 10% at any point of time. Further, we are required to ensure that total Tier-II capital, at any point of time, shall not exceed 100% of the Tier-I capital. For further details, see \u201cKey Regulations and Policies in India\u201d on page 179.

Further, in November 2023, the RBI issued a circular providing for an increased risk weight on consumer credit exposure (excluding home loans) from 100% to 125%. As a result, loans against property (excluding housing loans) without end use as business may attract the requirement of higher risk weights, which may reduce our CRWAR in the future.\n\nOur Company\u2019s business is dependent on its ability to raise funds at competitive rates, which in turn, depends on various factors including our credit ratings. Considering that the higher CRWAR would positively impact the credit ratings of our Company, which would lower the borrowing costs thereby positively impacting our interest margins and financial condition, we accordingly, propose to utilize an amount aggregating to \u20b9 7,500 million out of the Net Proceeds towards maintaining higher Tier 1 capital in light of our onward lending requirements. We believe that maintaining higher Tier 1 capital will help us remain competitive with our industry peers. We anticipate that the portion of the Net Proceeds allocated towards this object will be sufficient to satisfy our Company\u2019s future capital requirements, which are expected to arise out of growth of our business and assets.\n\n2.

India overtook UK to become the fifth largest economy in the world in 2022. In terms of purchasing power parity (\u201cPPP\u201d), India is the third largest economy in the world, only after China and the United States.\n\n1.2 Repo rate remains unchanged, with phase of aggressive rate hikes behind us\n\nIn Fiscal 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (\u201cRBI\u201d) raised the repo rate by 90 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) in the first quarter, and since then, it has continued to increase every quarter. By the third quarter of Fiscal 2024, the repo rate reached 6.50%, which signifies a substantial increase of 250 bps from the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. The initial rate hike occurred in May 2022, when the central bank\u2019s rate-setting panel unanimously raised the benchmark lending rate by 90 bps. However, the repo rate remains unchanged in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024 at 6.5% since the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023.\n\n1.3 Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d) inflation to average at 4.5% in Fiscal 2025\n\nCRISIL MI&A expects CPI inflation to continue to soften next Fiscal to 4.5% from an estimated 5.5% this Fiscal, supported by the assumption of a normal monsoon, softer domestic demand, and benign global oil prices. The distribution of the southwest monsoon and rabi output are expected to be key monitorable factors for food inflation in the first half of Fiscal 2025.\n\nMacroeconomic outlook for Fiscal 2025", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc336122-d294-47e0-8c94-e1c223928836": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc336122-d294-47e0-8c94-e1c223928836", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Note: E \u2013 Estimated; P \u2013 Projected Source: RBI, NSO, CRISIL MI&A\n\n119", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfc6b8db-c0d8-49d0-a024-bfa5c60214bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfc6b8db-c0d8-49d0-a024-bfa5c60214bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "2. Key growth drivers\n\nIndia has the world\u2019s largest population\n\nAs per Census 2011, India\u2019s population was approximately 1.25 billion, and comprised nearly 245 million households, is expected by CRISIL MI&A to increase to 1.52 billion by 2031, and number of households are expected to reach approximately 376 million over the same period.\n\n2.1.2 Favorable demographics\n\nAs of calendar year 2022, India has one of the largest young populations in the world, with a median age of 28 years. CRISIL MI&A estimated that approximately 90% of Indians were still below the age of 60 in calendar year 2021 and that 63% of them were between 15 and 59 years. In comparison, in calendar year 2020, the United States (US), China and Brazil had 77%, 83% and 86%, respectively, of their population below the age of 60.\n\n2.1.3 Urbanization\n\nUrbanization is one of India\u2019s most important economic growth drivers. It is expected to drive substantial investments in infrastructure development. India\u2019s urban population has been rising consistently over the decades (Source: World Urbanization Prospects). As per the 2018 revision of World Urbanization Prospects, it was estimated at 34.9% for India. According to the World Urbanization Prospects, the percentage of population residing in urban areas in India is expected to increase to 37.4% by 2025.\n\nIncreasing per capita GDP to support economic growth\n\nIn Fiscal 2024, India\u2019s per capita net national income expanded by 6.8% reflecting robust growth of Indian economy and government\u2019s continued efforts to make India an upper middle-income economy.\n\n2.1.5 Rising Middle India population to help sustain growth for the country\n\nProportion of Middle India (defined as households with annual income of between \u20b9 0.2 to 1 million) has been on a rise over the last decade and is expected to grow further with continuous increase in the GDP and household incomes. CRISIL MI&A estimates that there were 41 million middle income households in India as of Fiscal 2012, and by Fiscal 2030, they are projected to increase to 181 million households. A large number of these households, which have entered the Middle-Income bracket in the last few years, are likely to be from semi-urban and rural areas.\n\nCRISIL MI&A believes that the improvement in the literacy levels, increasing access to information and awareness, increases in the availability of necessities, and the improvement in road infrastructure has led to an increase in aspirations of Middle India, which is likely to translate into increased opportunities for financial service providers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f8abb86-db35-4d91-9ecc-f6f16dc9522a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f8abb86-db35-4d91-9ecc-f6f16dc9522a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Financial Inclusion on a fast path in India\n\nIndia\u2019s financial inclusion has improved significantly over calendar years 2014 to 2021 as adult population with bank accounts increased from 53% to 78% (Source: Global Findex Database) due to the Indian government\u2019s concentrated efforts to promote financial inclusion and the proliferation of supporting institutions.\n\nFinancial penetration to rise with increase in awareness of financial products\n\nWith increasing financial literacy, mobile penetration, awareness and the Prime Minister\u2019s Jan Dhan Yojana bank accounts (scheme aimed at bringing the unbanked under the formal banking system), there has been a rise in the participation of individuals from non-metro cities in banking. With more people attached to the formal banking sector, the demand for financial products in smaller cities has seen a major uptick in recent years. Going forward, CRISIL MI&A expects financial penetration to increase on account of increasing financial literacy.\n\n2.2 Credit penetration in India\n\n2.2.1 Credit penetration is lower in India compared to other countries\n\nIn terms of the credit to GDP ratio, India has a low credit penetration compared with other developing countries, such as China indicating the potential that can be tapped.

Between the same period, credit share has witnessed a marginal rise in rural and urban areas. For semi-urban areas, credit share has gone up from 12% as of March 31, 2019, to 14% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, rural areas, which accounted for 47% of GDP, received just 8% of the overall banking credit, which shows the vast market opportunity for banks and NBFCs to lend in these areas. With increasing focus of government towards financial inclusion, rising financial awareness, increasing smartphone and internet penetration, CRISIL MI&A expects delivery of credit services in rural area to increase. Further, usage of alternative data to underwrite customers is expected to also help the financiers to assess customers and cater to the informal sections of the society in these regions.\n\n121", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b24462ec-1c64-4443-8566-6f87fb6d3838": {"__data__": {"id_": "b24462ec-1c64-4443-8566-6f87fb6d3838", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Share of rural and semi-urban credit has increased marginally between March 2019 and March 2023\n\n100%  80%  60%  66%  65%  63%  62%  62%  61%  40%  20%  0%  15%  12% 7%  15%  12% 7%  16%  13% 8%  17%  13% 8%  17%  13% 8%  18%  14% 8%  FY2019  FY2020  FY2021  FY2022  FY2023  9MFY24  Rural  Semi Urban  Urban  Metropolitan \n\nNote: As at the end of each Fiscal and as of December 2023 for 9MFY2024; Source: RBI, MOSPI, CRISIL MI&A\n\n2.4 NBFC credit to grow faster than systemic credit between Fiscals 2023 and 2025\n\nCRISIL MI&A projects NBFC credit to grow at 12%-14% between Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2025. The credit growth is expected to be driven by the retail vertical, including housing, auto, and microfinance segments. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand in Fiscal 2024, leading to healthy growth of NBFCs. Moreover, organic consolidation is underway with larger NBFCs gaining share. Further, growth of the non-banking industry is expected to be driven mainly by NBFCs with strong parentage who have funding advantage over other NBFCs.\n\nNBFC credit to grow at CAGR 16-18% between Fiscals 2023 and 2025 Share of NBFC Credit in Systemic Credit remained at 18% in Fiscal 2023\n\n45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0  21  24  26  28  30  34  38  42   FY18  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23 FY24P FY25P  NBFC credit (In INR tn) \n\n17% 17%  9% 10% 10% 9%  8%  66% 65%  73% 71% 72% 73% 74% 75%  18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18%  FY18  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22 FY23 FY24P FY25P  NBFC credit  Bank credit  Others  6% \n\nNote: P = Projected; Note: Others include Commercial papers, External borrowings, corporate bonds excluding those issued by Banks and NBFCs Source: RBI, Company reports, CRISIL MI&A\n\nCRISIL MI&A believes that NBFCs will remain a force to reckon within the Indian credit landscape, given their inherent strength of providing last-mile funding and catering to customer segments that are not catered by Banks.\n\n2.5 Retail segment to support NBFCs overall credit growth\n\nAfter a moderation in growth post pandemic, NBFCs are back on track with an estimated credit growth of 12-13% during Fiscal 2023. Going ahead CRISIL MI&A expects the growth trend to continue with credit growth at 13-14% during Fiscal 2024. The industry is expected to continue to witness the emergence of newer NBFCs catering to specific customer segments. The COVID- 19 pandemic and consequent acceleration in both adoption of technology and change in consumer habits as well as increasing availability of data for credit decision-making has made it possible to build an NBFC lending business without investing large sums to have brick-and-mortar presence on the ground. Overall, between Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2025, CRISIL MI&A forecasts NBFC credit to grow at a CAGR of 12%-14%. Further, retail credit given out by NBFCs is forecast to grow at a pace of 13%- 15% CAGR over the same time.\n\n122", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db52bb0c-452a-4f0f-8c5f-01926df967f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "db52bb0c-452a-4f0f-8c5f-01926df967f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Share of retail credit in total NBFC credit to continue to grow\n\n57% 56% 56% 55% 55% 54% 54% 53%  54%  55%  56%  FY18  FY23  FY25P \n\nNote: P = Projected; Retail credit above includes housing finance, auto finance, microfinance, gold loans, consumer durable finance, MSME loans, education loans & others Source: Company reports, CRISIL MI&A\n\n2.5.1 Retail credit market continue to remain profitable in the coming years\n\nFactors that will support retail credit growth\n\nFormalizat ion of  economy  Growing  working  population  Increasing  urbanizati on  Increasing  digital  adoption  Financial  Inclusion  Increasing  Disposabl e Income \n\nSource: CRISIL MI&A\n\n2.5.2 Housing loans accounts for 46% of overall retail loans as of March 31, 2023\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, housing finance accounts for almost half of overall retail loans in India followed by auto loans (17%), personal loans (17%) and gold loan (12%).\n\nRetail credit mix as of March 31, 2023\n\nMicrofinance, 6%  Consumer Durable, 1%  Gold Loan, 12%  Housing, 46%  Personal Loan, 17%  Auto, 17% \n\nSource: CRISIL MI&A\n\n2.5.3 Housing and Autos to lead NBFC credit growth\n\n123", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d2b9f8f-f88c-4123-81e0-2a9453d8066a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d2b9f8f-f88c-4123-81e0-2a9453d8066a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Housing finance had second lowest credit cost among retail loans, which is expected to continue\n\nHousing Finance  Auto Finance  0.60%  0.70%  0.60%  0.50%  0.60%  2.10% 1.90%  1.60%  2.50%  1.80% 1.70%  0.20%  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24 P     FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24 P  Gold  Micro Finance  0.20%  3.90%  0.10% 0.10%  0.10% 0.10% 0.10%  0.60%  1.40%  2.90%  2.40% 2.00%  FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24 P     FY19  FY20  FY21  FY22  FY23  FY24 P \n\nNote: P = Projected, Source: CRISIL MI&A\n\n3.

As per the report of RBI-appointed Committee on the Development of housing finance securitization market (September 2019), the housing shortage in India was estimated to increase to 100 million units by 2022. Majority of the household shortage is for LIG and EWS with a small proportion of shortage (5-7%) of the shortage coming from MIG or above. Total incremental housing loans demand, if this entire shortage is to be addressed, is estimated to be in the region of \u20b9 50 trillion to \u20b9 60 trillion, as per the Committee report. In comparison, the overall housing loans outstanding (excluding Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (\u201cPMAY\u201d) loans) as of March 2023 was around \u20b9 31.1 trillion.

Though low compared with other developing countries, it has significantly improved from 6.5% in Fiscal 2009. The factors that contributed to the improvement are rising incomes, improving affordability, growing urbanization and nuclearization of families, emergence of tier-II and tier-III cities, ease of financing, tax incentives, and widening reach of financiers. Given the expected steady growth from Fiscal 2023, CRISIL MI&A projects the ratio at 14-15% by Fiscal 2025.\n\nFactors affecting mortgage-to-GDP ratio in India\n\nMortgage penetration in India is far lower than other emerging economies owing to lower per capita income and higher proportion of informal employment in India. However, CRISIL MI&A believes rising urbanization, growing disposable income, favorable demographics and government measures will lead to higher mortgage penetration going forward.\n\n126", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29214beb-4d20-41f5-a9d1-411edc8383be": {"__data__": {"id_": "29214beb-4d20-41f5-a9d1-411edc8383be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "1- Higher affordability led by  increase in disposable income  2- Rapid growth in urbanisation 3- Higher proportion of young  population 4- Government measures to push  housing sector such as \"Housing for  all\", impetus packages to tackle the  pandemic, NHB Refinance scheme,  SARFAESI Act, etc.  1- Low per capita GDP 2- Relatively high house prices 3- High percentage of population in  informal employement 4- Information asymmetry in smaller  cities 5- Insufficient long-term capital 6- Inadequate legal infrastructure \n\nSource: CRISIL MI&A\n\n3.4 Favorable Demographic\n\nShift towards younger age profile for home loan borrowings\n\nIndia\u2019s demographic profile is expected to favor the housing industry, leading to growth in the housing finance market.\n\nDeclining age of borrowers\n\nAverage age of borrowers  35  33  30  FY15E  FY20E  FY25P \n\nNote: E \u2013 Estimated, P \u2013 Projected, Source: CRISIL MI&A\n\n3.4.2 Continuous increase in share of urban population to boost demand for housing in urban areas The urban population was 377 million in 2011, marking a CAGR (2001-2011) of 2.8%; rural population was 833 million, up at a CAGR (2001-2011) of 1.15%. Urbanization levels rose from 28% in 2001 to about 31% in 2011. It was expected to have reached about 35% in 2021. This percentage is expected to increase further in the years to come, thereby translating into higher demand for housing and related amenities in the urban areas.\n\n3.5 Rise in number of nuclear families leads to formation of new houses\n\nNuclearization refers to formation of multiple single families out of one large joint family. Each family lives in a separate house, while the ancestral house may be retained or partitioned to buy new houses. Nuclearization in urban areas is primarily driven by changing lifestyle of people, individualism, changing social/cultural attitudes, and increased mobility of labor in search of better employment opportunities. These trends are expected to continue in future.\n\n3.6 Rising demand for independent houses\n\nIndians traditionally prefer to live in independent houses. However, the increase in population density, especially in urban areas, has increased the demand for flats. As per Census Data 2011 it has been very clear that Indians do prefer independent housing.

Business Model of housing financiers focused on low income housing segment\n\nHousing financiers focused on low income housing segment typically serve the underserved category of low-income or mid- income customers who may be salaried, working in the informal sector or self-employed running a small business. Many a times, these customers do not have adequate documentation that can serve as proof of their income. Also, as these customers are in economically weaker segments they face challenges in accessing organized institutional lending, and hence largely rely on loans from informal sources, including moneylenders and local businessmen at higher rates of interest.\n\nThe high cost of serving this category of customers has prompted financiers to adopt innovative models to source business. An HFC targeting this segment of customers usually has a hub and spoke model where retail branches of the HFC operate as \u2018hubs\u2019 in urban areas, while small kiosks are set up near areas where construction activity is taking place to source customers. Financiers also spread awareness about their products in rural areas by setting up kiosks at \u2018gram sabhas\u2019 and arranging \u2018loan melas\u2019 for potential customers.\n\nHowever, some players also rely on customers indulging in self-construction of their houses in tier-2 and tier-3 cities in need of credit. These players have sourcing strategies focused on attracting customers with touch points in nearby locations.\n\nUsually, close to 70% of the overall business of HFCs focused on low income housing segment is sourced through direct sales teams. Direct customer contact through these teams enables better visibility and helps limit fraud, thus making for reliable customer assessment. Moreover, all critical functions like origination, verification and credit appraisal are performed in-house, while certain non-core activities like loan documentation and document processing may be outsourced. This allows HFCs in this segment to allocate more internal resources towards vital aspects of lending such as verification, credit appraisal and credit assessment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96ffeaa1-a2eb-4179-85ed-ee4a983f7f90": {"__data__": {"id_": "96ffeaa1-a2eb-4179-85ed-ee4a983f7f90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Exploring the low income housing (<\u20b9 1.5 million) segment\n\nIN INR . ) Large and mid-size HFC\u2019s Banks and large HFC\u2019s Surrogates such as EMI multiplier, supplier and \u2014 Willing to give! customer checks, or MFI's and Chit funds savings mang \u00a9 give SECC . \" documented income history used to access credit.

Profitability analysis\n\nHigher returns, lesser competition makes the low-income housing segment attractive amongst the HFCs\n\nHousing loans are considered to be a safer asset class compared with other asset classes such as vehicle loans, construction equipment loans and personal loans, as borrowing is usually for a self-occupied residential property of the borrower, where the propensity of default is relatively lower.\n\nAmong the peer group set (large, medium, small, mini and HFCs focused on low-income housing segment), HFCs focused on low-income housing segment have highest profitability - return on assets (\u201cRoA\u201d). The higher RoA of HFCs focused on low- income housing segment \u2013 3.1% in Fiscal 2023 \u2013 can be attributed to the relatively higher net interest margins (\u201cNIMs\u201d) they enjoy despite their higher cost of funds. The higher NIMs is due to the higher interest rates they charge the customers. In Fiscal 2023, profitability increased for medium, small, mini and HFCs focused on low-income segment.\n\n141", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "712157f1-2171-4329-99ff-a8abfb9c808d": {"__data__": {"id_": "712157f1-2171-4329-99ff-a8abfb9c808d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Over the longer term, CRISIL MI&A expects the low income housing industry\u2019s profitability to gradually improve.

We formulated a separate product, Aadhar Gram Unnati (\u201cAGU\u201d), considering the local needs and challenges of our customers in such semi-urban markets. Our AGU product provides us with a platform to test the market demand in new geographies we wish to expand into, particularly semi-urban locations.

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023, \u20b9130,496.9 million or 75.8% and \u20b9144,880.4 million or 72.9% of our Gross AUM and 87.1% and 85.5% of our live accounts was from customers who belonged to the economically weaker and low income group, earning less than \u20b950,000 per month, respectively. Many of our loans are provided under the various affordable housing schemes promoted by the Government of India, such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which benefits economically weaker segment, low income group and medium income group citizens in urban and semi-urban areas. These loans constitute 23.7% of our live accounts and \u20b939,128.4 million or 19.7% of our Gross AUM as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition to our customer-facing social objectives, we have also implemented social initiatives in other aspects of our business. Our presence in urban and semi-urban locations across India results in us providing employment opportunities for people in these locations. For example, in 2018, we launched a sales channel called 'Aadhar Mitra'. Aadhar Mitras are people in non- allied industries (for example, hardware owners, property brokers and building material suppliers) who act as lead providers to our sales teams. We have enrolled 12,451 Aadhar Mitras as of December 31, 2023 and provide these people with an alternate source of income (i.e., referral fees for referring loans that are paid out on disbursements to customers sourced by them).\n\nThrough the provision of loans for purchase of homes to a customer segment that is not serviced by the mainstream financial\n\n159", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "367aa0e4-fe6c-4104-a6d0-36d8a49a55c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "367aa0e4-fe6c-4104-a6d0-36d8a49a55c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "services sector and our employment of personnel in urban and semi-urban locations across India, we believe we are fulfilling an important social objective of economic uplift for these segments of the Indian economy.\n\nFor further details in relation to our corporate social responsibility initiatives, see \u201c\u2013 Our Business Operations \u2013 Corporate Social Responsibility\u201d on page 177.\n\nExperienced, cycle-tested and professional management team with strong corporate governance\n\nOur board of directors is comprised of qualified and experienced personnel, who have extensive knowledge and understanding of the banking and finance industry.

Karve (previously associated with Price Water House as a partner). For further information, see \u201cOur Management\u201d beginning on page 196.\n\nIn addition, we have a strong and experienced management team comprising sixteen members. Our management team brings a diverse array of backgrounds, with a mix of professionals from the financial services industry. We believe that the diversity and experience of our management gives us the strength to formulate and execute a broad array of strategies, dealing with a wide spectrum of product and customer segments and successfully navigating a wide range of risks inherent in the financial services industry.\n\nSince June 2019, BCP Topco, which is in turn an affiliate of funds managed by Blackstone, is our Promoter and currently holds 98.72% of our pre-Offer issued, subscribed and paid-up Equity Share capital. We benefit from the resources, relationships and expertise of Blackstone, one of the world's leading investment firms. Blackstone's asset management businesses include investment vehicles focused on real estate, private equity, public debt and equity, growth equity, opportunistic, non-investment grade credit, real assets and secondary funds, all on a global basis. Through its different businesses, Blackstone had total assets under management of $1,040.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Following our acquisition by Blackstone, we implemented a corporate governance framework, with the induction of three independent directors, one of whom serves as Non-Executive Chairman.\n\nFor further details in relation to the demonstration of the strength of our business and our management team, see \u201c-Competitive Strengths \u2013 Seasoned business model with strong resilience through business cycles\u201d on page 155.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "064937d4-c357-4420-a5db-6ea16192db6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "064937d4-c357-4420-a5db-6ea16192db6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Our Strategy\n\nExpand our Distribution Network to Achieve Deeper Penetration in key states\n\nWe have a comprehensive pan-India presence covering our target customers. With increased urbanization across India, we believe that the continuing expansion of our physical and digital presence across India will be a key enabler for our growth. We believe that our current operating model is scalable, which will assist us in expanding our operations with lower incremental costs to drive efficiency and profitability.\n\nOur branch expansion is done in a calibrated and systematic manner. We review a number of factors including demographics and competitive landscape before establishing a branch. We have modelled our branches into categories to manage costs and risks while expanding our presence. To drive our geographical expansion, we employ our AGU product which allows us to test the market demand in new geographies, particularly semi-urban locations, after which we set up the branches that commensurate with the local demand. We also have sales offices (also known as deep impact branches) that are opened in remote locations with a limited number of officers and we provide small office space for customer meetings and collection of documentation at these sales offices. We have ultra-micro and micro branches that are minimally staffed but have the ability to source customers for certain locations. For other locations we have small branches and main branches to provide higher levels of disbursements and cater to a larger pool of customers. This approach allows us to gauge the potential of a particular location without incurring the costs of opening a branch location and provides the flexibility of expanding from sales offices to ultra-micro branches and further to small or main branches where there is a business potential for expansion. We are constantly evaluating locations using the above criteria and expect to continue to add branches to grow out network in the near term.\n\nContinue to focus on our target customers and grow our customer base\n\nIn FY2023, our customers reached 233,000 accounts and we have more than 255,000 Live Accounts as of December 31, 2023.

As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023, 58.6% and 57.2% of our customers are salaried individuals and 41.4% and 42.8% are self-employed individuals, respectively. Majority of the household shortage is for LIG and EWS with a small proportion of shortage (5.0-7.0%) of the shortage coming from MIG or above.

We believe our objective of financial inclusion for these categories of customers coupled with our digitally enabled customer centric approach will allow us to continue to grow our customer base and our loan portfolio. We also grow our customer base by entering into co-lending arrangements with other banks, see \u201c\u2013 Our Strategy \u2013 Optimize our borrowing costs and reduce operating expenses further\u201d on page 161 for further details. In addition, we may also explore selective opportunistic acquisitions of low income housing segment loan portfolios from banks and financial institutions as means of inorganic growth.\n\nContinue to invest in and roll out digital and technology enabled solutions across our business to improve customer experience and improve cost efficiency\n\nIn October 2021, we implemented an enterprise-wide technology upgrade of our systems and processes. These investments are aimed at modernizing our technology backbone and digitizing operating processes. For further information, see \"\u2013 Information Technology\" on page 173. We believe that these initiatives will assist in streamlining of existing processes and the introduction of enhanced features.\n\nFurther, we aim to make the process of buying a house for our customers seamless by building a digitally-driven and enabled HFC focused on the low income housing segment. The key components of this are the simplification of processes, growing our reach, efficient and comprehensive risk management combined with a superior customer experience.\n\nOur credit underwriting, risk management and fraud detection teams utilize technology to process loan applications, analyze credit risks, identify fraud and utilize an objective cognitive rule-based policy to make credit decisions.

The partnerships with the two public sector banks have been operationalized. We may also enter into such arrangements with other private and public sector banks to increase the number of our co-lending partners.

This model allows NBFCs or HFCs to cater to a larger customer base with lesser capital by leveraging the larger balance sheet of their partner banks.\n\nRBI had amended the co-lending framework in November 2020 to improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sector of the economy and make available funds to the ultimate beneficiary at an affordable cost, considering the lower cost of funds from banks and wider reach of the NBFCs. Under the terms of the revised Co-Lending Model (\u201cCLM\u201d), banks are now also permitted to co-lend with all registered NBFCs (including HFCs) based on a prior agreement in a manner akin to bilateral assignment.

We offer loans to both salaried and self-employed individuals in the formal and informal segments. We cater to customers from informal employment sectors who do not have formal income proofs, pay slips, or income tax returns, and hence may be excluded from being served by banks or large financial institutions. For the income-wise split of our formal and informal customers, see \u201c\u2013 Competitive Strengths \u2013 HFC focused on the low income housing segment (ticket size less than \u20b91.5 million) in India with the highest AUM and net worth among our analyzed peers in FY2021, FY2022, FY2023 and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023\u201d on page 154. As a result of our expertise, experience and business model, we believe that we are able to effectively serve such customers and grow our business, while monitoring and mitigating risks. We have developed detailed customer interviews as part of our personal discussion process, which provide us deep insights into behavioral traits and other data points which substitute some of the traditional data.\n\nKey Parameters of our loan products: LTV Ratio, EMI and Tenure of our Home Loans\n\nThe RBI Master Directions \u2013 HFC prescribe the thresholds of loans that can be provided to housing loan customers. A property with market value of up to \u20b93.0 million is permitted to have a maximum loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) of up to 90.0%, property with market value between \u20b93.0 million and \u20b97.5 million is permitted to have maximum LTV ratio of up to 80.0% and property with market value above \u20b97.5 million is permitted to have maximum LTV ratio of up to 75.0%.

The amount of the loan is determined on the basis of our evaluation of the repayment capacity of a customer and the value of the relevant property, and is also subject to regulatory limits. Loans are required to be repaid in equated monthly instalments (\u201cEMIs\u201d) over an agreed period. The size of the EMI depends on the size of loan, interest rate and tenure of loan.

As of December 31, 2023, all of our outstanding loans are secured in our favor by a mortgage over property or other security.\n\nWe require our customers to pay certain processing fees and charges prior to the disbursement of the loans at different stages of the loan application. These fees and charges are subject to change from time to time based on market conditions and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe underlying collateral for a loan is the house or property towards which the loan is provided. The security for home loans is created either through an equitable mortgage by way of deposit of title deeds or a registered mortgage of immovable property. We also offer our customers an option to take an insurance cover for the home, with the sum assured cover of at least the home loan amount, which offers an additional cover for any damage to the collateral.\n\nLoan sourcing\n\nWe generate loans through both in-house and external sources. We use a combination of our in-house sales teams, including direct selling teams (\u201cDSTs\u201d) and sales managers. Our external channels include direct sales agents (\u201cDSAs\u201d) and Aadhar Mitras. As of December 31, 2023, our direct selling team including sales managers comprised 3,177 members.

For further details, see \"- Credit Approval and Disbursement Process\" on page 167.\n\nIn 2018, with a view to lowering our cost of acquisition for new loans and to widen our reach, we launched the 'Aadhar Mitra Program'. Aadhar Mitras are individuals engaged by us who may be in a non-allied industry (for example, hardware store owners, property brokers and building material suppliers) and act as lead providers to our DSTs. We incentivize Aadhar Mitras with a referral fee for every referral that results in a loan disbursal by us. Our onboarding process for Aadhar Mitras involves the verification of documents of a prospective Aadhar Mitra by our local branch, followed by training programs for the Aadhar Mitra. In August 2021, we launched a \u201cMahila Aadhar Mitra\u201d program which catered to enrolling women as Aadhar Mitras. This enables us to widen our network of Aadhar Mitras and at the same time helps to providing a source of income to our Mahila Aadhar Mitras.\n\n166", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c15d12e2-4de0-4a5d-b533-f9ee433dbf41": {"__data__": {"id_": "c15d12e2-4de0-4a5d-b533-f9ee433dbf41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Further, we also generate business through corporate channel partners and digital platforms such as digital lead aggregators under the 'Digital Aadhar Mitra' program website and social media platforms.\n\nCredit Approval and Disbursement Processes\n\nFor credit underwriting, we use both technology as well as manual verification methods through our well-trained credit officers. Through a mix of technology and manual verification, our credit team can underwrite customers belonging to both formal and informal employment segments. We verify KYC documents and income of customers from the formal employment segment using technology led solutions (for example, the online verification of PAN, Aadhar number, Voter identification data, EPF, TDS, company/employer profile and income tax returns).

We have obtained financing from a variety of sources including term loans and cash credit/ working capital facilities; proceeds from loans assigned; proceeds from the issuance of NCDs; refinancing from the NHB; and subordinated debt borrowings from banks, mutual funds and insurance companies to meet our capital requirements. We assign loans through direct assignment to banks and financial institutions, which enables us to optimize our cost of borrowings, funding and liquidity requirements, capital management and asset liability management.

This risk may arise from the unexpected increase in the cost of funding an asset portfolio at the appropriate maturity and the risk of being unable to liquidate a position in a timely manner and at a reasonable price. We monitor liquidity risk through our Asset Liability Management Committee. Monitoring liquidity risk involves categorizing all assets and liabilities into different maturity profiles and evaluating them for any mismatches in any particular maturities, particularly in the short-term. We actively monitor our liquidity position to ensure that we can meet all borrower and lender-related funding requirements.\n\nWe continuously seek to diversify our sources of funding to facilitate flexibility in meeting our funding requirements.

We have implemented digital solutions across various aspects of our business with these objectives in mind. Our credit underwriting, risk management and fraud detection teams utilize technology to centrally process loan applications, analyze credit risks, identify fraud and utilize an objective cognitive rule-based policy to make credit decisions. These technology-led initiatives allow us to increase our customer penetration through third party utilization for sourcing customers (as is the case with our digital Aadhar Mitras) while keeping credit appraisals in-house. Further, these technology solutions ensure data integration across all platforms and reduce manual intervention. The digitization of our work processes and functions improves the customer experience through more convenient accessibility, better customer service and engagement and faster turnaround time driven by faster decision making. Operationally, automation / digitization benefits us through improved underwriting processes, increased productivity, cost reduction and improved collections through data-driven early warning systems.\n\nTill September 2021, we utilized an enterprise-wide loan management system, Synergy, to provide an integrated platform for loan processing, credit processing, general ledger, debt management and reporting.

We utilize our analytics platform to improve business while managing risks. Through this platform, several management information system reports are generated, including on an automated basis, which helps us optimize our operations.\n\nWe have implemented an online payment gateway on our website to enable our customers to make their payments via modes such as internet banking, UPI and debit cards. In addition to this, we are integrated with banks and online payment aggregators which enables customer to pay at the nearest collection point as well thereby improving collection efficiency. We conduct regular tracking of our collections team and have provided them with mobile applications to enable them to collect payments from our customers.

The RAG segmentation model integrates data science in credit underwriting to provide the basis for our risk-based pricing. For instance, based on the application scorecards non-creditworthy loan applicants will be automatically rejected. The RAG segmentation and risk-based pricing facilitate our key objectives of increased operational efficiency in underwriting, improved portfolio risk management, heightened approval rates, and amplified yields. Our branch opening strategy has undergone a transformation, and is driven by data science methodologies. We emphasize on customer retention through data-driven strategies to mitigate outward balance transfers and identify refinancing opportunities.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, we have implemented a comprehensive data warehouse, for our data discovery, visualization, and data science.

Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation.\n\na.

Repayment of housing and property loan is by way of Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) comprising of principal and interest. EMIs generally commence once the loan is disbursed. Pending commencement of EMIs, pre-EMI interest is payable every month on the loan that has been disbursed. Interest is calculated either on annual rest or on monthly rest basis in terms of the financing scheme opted by the borrower.\n\nInterest income on housing and property loans and other financial instruments carried at amortised cost is recognised on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the effective interest rate (\u201cEIR\u201d) applicable.\n\nThe EIR considers all fees, charges, transaction costs, and other premiums or discounts that are incremental and directly attributable to the specific financial instrument at the time of its origination.

Interest income on credit-impaired financial assets is calculated on net carrying value (i.e. the gross carrying amount less the allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs)).\n\nb. Fee and commission income: Fee and commission, other than the fee that forms an integral part of EIR, are accounted on accrual basis.\n\nc. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Group\u2019s right to receive dividend is established by the reporting date.\n\nd. Investment income The gains/losses on sale of investments are recognised in the statement of profit and loss on trade date. Gain or loss on sale of investments is determined on the basis of weighted average cost.\n\ne. Other operating revenue: Prepayment charges, delayed payment interest and other such incomes where recovery is uncertain are recognised on receipt basis.\n\n2.7 Property, plant and equipment and Intangible Assets Property plant and equipment (PPE) PPE is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. PPE is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation/ amortization and impairment losses, if any. The cost of PPE is its purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable from the tax authorities), any directly attributable expenditure on making the PPE ready for its intended use, other incidental expenses and interest on borrowing attributable to acquisition of qualifying PPE upto the date the asset is ready for its intended use.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.

Intangible assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortisation and cumulative impairment. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible assets. Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as \u201cIntangible assets under development\u201d.\n\nIntangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of 3 years. The method of amortisation and useful life are reviewed at the end of each accounting year with the effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Amortisation on impaired assets is provided by adjusting the amortisation charge in the remaining periods so as to allocate the asset\u2019s revised carrying amount over its remaining useful life. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\nImpairment of assets As at the end of each financial period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PPE and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the PPE and intangible assets are tested for impairment so as to determine the impairment loss, if any.\n\nImpairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, such deficit is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss as impairment loss and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c0a3297-8dc4-4fd6-b5da-a33d43b06e52": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c0a3297-8dc4-4fd6-b5da-a33d43b06e52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss was recognised for the asset in prior years.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed periodically by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognition of the asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nRemeasurement of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).

Other long-term employee benefits\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised as a liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets out of which the obligations are expected to be settled.\n\nShare-based payment arrangements The share appreciation rights / stock options granted to employees pursuant to the Group\u2019s Stock appreciation rights scheme / stock options policy are measured at the fair value of the rights at the grant date. The fair value of the rights / options is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost over the vesting period on a straight line basis. The amount recognised as expense in each period is at based on the number of grants expected to vest. If a grant lapses after the vesting period, the cumulative discount recognised as expense in respect of such grant is transferred to the general reserve within other equity.\n\n2.9 Leases The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease.\n\n259", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32841ab5-e8a0-431a-a982-7a6ea4be0be9": {"__data__": {"id_": "32841ab5-e8a0-431a-a982-7a6ea4be0be9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "AADHAR HOUSING FINANCE LIMITED CIN U66010KA1990PLC011409\n\nSummary of Material accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n2.10 Financial instruments Recognition of financial instruments Financial instruments comprise of financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group\u2019s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets primarily comprise of loans and advances, deposits, trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial liabilities primarily comprise of deposits, borrowings (other than debt securities), debt securities, subordinate liabilities and trade payables.\n\nInitial measurement of financial instruments Recognised financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs and revenues that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs and revenues directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e790fe43-65bb-45c8-a37f-1d4ebfe1c8ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "e790fe43-65bb-45c8-a37f-1d4ebfe1c8ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "If the transaction price differs from fair value at initial recognition, the Group will account for such difference as follows:\n\ne\n\ne\n\nif fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then the difference is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on initial recognition (i.e. day 1 profit or loss); in all other cases, the fair value will be adjusted to bring it in line with the transaction price (i.e. day 1 profit or loss will be deferred by including it in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability).\n\nAfter initial recognition, the deferred gain or loss will be released to profit or loss on a rational basis, only to the extent that it arises from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability.\n\n260", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8d94284-6631-4d88-bec1-4fe764e6443b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8d94284-6631-4d88-bec1-4fe764e6443b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "AADHAR HOUSING FINANCE LIMITED CIN U66010KA1990PLC011409\n\nSummary of Material accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nFinancial assets Classification of financial assets\n\ndebt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI), are subsequently measured at amortised cost; all other debt instruments (e.g. debt instruments managed on a fair value basis, or held for sale) and equity investments are subsequently measured at FVTPL.\n\nHowever, the Group may make the following irrevocable election / designation at initial recognition of a financial asset on an asset-by-asset basis:\n\ne", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6f4c167-58a0-476a-9114-5a252b916bfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6f4c167-58a0-476a-9114-5a252b916bfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "e\n\nthe Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 - Business Combination applies, in OCI; and the Group may irrevocably designate a debt instrument that meets the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch (referred to as the fair value option).\n\nA financial asset is held for trading if: \u2022 \u2022 on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and\n\non initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or\n\nhas a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument or a financial guarantee\n\nInvestment in equity instruments at FVOCI The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group\u2019s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI.

Contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are SPPI.

Financial instruments (i) Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy to determine the fair values of its financial instruments that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements:\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes listed equity instruments and mutual funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all equity instruments which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price as at the reporting period. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the- counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3.\n\nThere were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.\n\nThe Group recognises transfers in and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n(ii) Valuation process The management of the Group performs the valuations of financial assets and liabilities required for financial reporting purposes.\n\nThe carrying amounts of trade receivables, trade payables, capital creditors and cash and cash equivalents are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.\n\nThe fair values for loans are calculated based on cash flows discounted using a current lending rate. They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs including counterparty credit risk.\n\nThe fair values of borrowings are based on discounted cash flows using a current borrowing rate. They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, including own credit risk.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to the fair values.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

Financial risk management a. Liquidity risk is the current and prospective risk arising out of an inability to meet financial commitments as they fall due, through available cash flows or through the sale of assets at fair market value. It includes both, the risk of unexpected increases in the cost of funding an asset portfolio at appropriate maturities and the risk of being unable to liquidate a position in a timely manner at a reasonable price.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and by having access to funding through an adequate amount of committed credit lines. Given the need to fund diverse products, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines to meet obligations when due. Management regularly monitors the position of cash and cash equivalents vis-\u00e0-vis projections. Assessment of maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities including debt financing plans and maintenance of Balance Sheet liquidity ratios are considered while reviewing the liquidity position.\n\nLiquidity risk is managed in accordance with our Asset Liability Management Policy. This policy is framed as per the current regulatory guidelines and is approved by the Board of Directors. The Asset Liability Management Policy is reviewed periodically to incorporate changes as required by regulatory stipulation or to realign the policy with changes in the economic landscape. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Group formulates and reviews strategies and provides guidance for management of liquidity risk within the framework laid out in the Asset Liability Management Policy.\n\nMaturity Analysis of Financial assets and Financial Liabilities As at December 31, 2023", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

The core business of the Group is providing housing and other mortgage loans. The Group borrows through various financial instruments to finance its core lending activity. These activities expose the Group to interest rate risk.\n\nInterest rate risk is measured through earnings at risk from an earnings perspective and through duration of equity from an economic value perspective. Further, exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is also measured by way of gap analysis, providing a static view of the maturity and re-pricing characteristic of Balance sheet positions. An interest rate sensitivity gap report is prepared by classifying all rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities into various time period categories according to contracted/behavioural maturities or anticipated re-pricing date. The difference in the amount of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities maturing or being re-priced in any time period category, gives an indication of the extent of exposure to the risk of potential changes in the margins on new or re-priced assets and liabilities. The interest rate risk is monitored through above measures on a quarterly basis.\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity The following table demonstrates the net sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rate (all other variables being constant) of the Group\u2019s statement of profit and loss (before taxes)\n\n(\u20b9 in Million) For the year ended March 31, 2021", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bad59b5-35cb-4c6d-9c11-c8c23497ce93": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bad59b5-35cb-4c6d-9c11-c8c23497ce93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "295", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01792f74-a2f0-427e-a180-8d5794539d80": {"__data__": {"id_": "01792f74-a2f0-427e-a180-8d5794539d80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "AADHAR HOUSING FINANCE LIMITED CIN U66010KA1990PLC011409\n\nNotes to restated consolidated financial information\n\nc. Credit risk is the risk of loss that may occur from the failure of any party to abide by the terms and conditions of any contract, principally the failure to make required payments of amounts due to the Group. In its lending operations, the Group is principally exposed to credit risk. The credit risk is governed by the Credit Policy approved by the Board of Directors. The Credit Policy outlines the type of products that can be offered, customer categories, the targeted customer profile and the credit approval process and limits.\n\nThe Group measures, monitors and manages credit risk at an individual borrower level and at the group exposure level for corporate borrowers. The credit risk for retail borrowers is being managed at portfolio level for both Home loans and other property loans. The Group has a structured and standardized credit approval process, which includes a well- established procedure of comprehensive credit appraisal. The Risk Management Policy addresses the recognition, measurement, monitoring and reporting of the Credit risk.\n\nCredit Risk Assessment Methodology Group\u2019s customers for retail loans are primarily lower and middle income, salaried and self-employed individuals. The loans are secured by the mortgage of the borrowers\u2019 property.\n\nThe Group\u2019s credit officers evaluate credit proposals on the basis of operating policies approved by the Board of Directors. The criteria typically include factors such as the borrower\u2019s income, the loan-to-value ratio and demographic parameters. Any deviations need to be approved at the designated levels.\n\nExternal agencies such as field investigation agencies facilitate a comprehensive due diligence process including visits to offices and homes in the case of loans made to retail borrowers.\n\nGroup monitor\u2019s borrower account behaviour as well as static data regularly to monitor the portfolio performance of each product segment regularly, and use these as inputs in revising its product programs, target market definitions and credit assessment criteria to meet the twin objectives of combining volume growth and maintenance of asset quality.\n\nThe Group\u2019s current credit risk grading framework comprises the following categories:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5a69718-0a35-4f40-83db-62fae0e0a75a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5a69718-0a35-4f40-83db-62fae0e0a75a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "The key elements in calculation of ECL are as follows:\n\nPD - The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon.

We took a number of proactive steps to counter the impact of COVID-19 on our business.

For all such accounts, where the moratorium was granted, the asset classification remained at a standstill during the moratorium period. During the Moratorium Period, we focused our operations on three main aspects: remaining in close contact with all our customers; improving collection efficiencies; and restarting disbursements with appropriate diligence. We continued regular engagement (through modes such as phone calls and text messages) with our customers during the Moratorium Period and continued to do so in the months following the Moratorium Period. As a result, while our collection efficiencies dipped in the month of April 2020, we steadily recovered from May 2020 onwards. Additionally, during the second wave of COVID-19 in April to May 2021, our overall business was impacted negatively with a slowdown both in our disbursements and collections, due to a surge in infections across the country, which resulted in localized lockdowns in various regions of India. Further, as regards to disbursements, we undertook limited disbursements during FY2021 and gradually increased our disbursements during FY2022 and FY2023. With a view of minimizing defaults, we focused more on salaried customers during this period.

With these measures in place, we were able to gradually increase our disbursements while at the same time improving our collection efficiencies.

We rely on our revenue from operations, equity in the form of shareholder funds, and debt, in the form of term loans, bank overdraft and working capital facilities; proceeds from the issuance of NCDs and commercial paper; refinancing from the NHB; and subordinated debt borrowings from banks, mutual funds, insurance companies and other domestic, financial institutions to meet our capital requirements. Further, we also assign loans through direct assignment to banks and financial institutions, which enables us to optimize our cost of borrowings, funding and liquidity requirements, capital management and asset liability management. With the objective to leverage our distribution network and widen our sources of funds, we enter into co-lending agreements with other banks, whereby we source and disburse loans in our usual course of business in accordance with our existing policies and may request these banks to participate in the specific home loans or loans against property with pre-agreed parameters. Our funding sources are varied, as we believe that a diversified debt profile ensures that we are not overly dependent on any one type or source for funding.\n\nOur debt service costs and overall cost of funds depend on many external factors, including developments in the Indian credit markets and, in particular, interest rate movements and the existence of adequate liquidity in the debt markets. Internal factors that affect our cost of funds include our credit ratings and available credit limits. For FY2021, FY2022 and FY2023 and the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, our average cost of borrowings was 8.2%, 7.2%, 7.0%, 7.0% and 7.6%, respectively. Any increase in our cost of funds may require us to increase interest rates on new loans originated to customers in the future to maintain our net interest margins, which may, in turn, decrease the competitiveness of our products and affect our results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe intend to continue to diversify our funding sources, identify new sources and pools of capital and implement robust asset liability management policies with the aim of further optimizing our borrowing costs and help sustain our net interest income. In line with our strategy, we have increased the share of NHB refinancing in our Total Borrowings from 16.4% as at March 31, 2021 to 27.3% as at December 31, 2023 and have also accessed international sources of funding to maintain our diversified\n\n339", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4373946-ce6f-47e6-b238-1d692af928fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4373946-ce6f-47e6-b238-1d692af928fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "funding sources.\n\nOur ability to maintain our net interest income and net interest margin\n\nOur results of operations depend substantially on the level of our net interest income (representing our total interest income as reduced by our total interest expended) and our ability to maintain and improve our net interest margin (representing the ratio of our net interest income to our total assets). Hence, the differential between the interest rates that we charge on interest-earning assets and the interest rates that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, and the volume of such assets and liabilities, tends to have a significant impact on our results of operations.\n\nWe provide loans to our customers at interest rates that are linked to our retail prime lending rate (\u201cRPLR\u201d), which is calculated by us based on the interest rate that we pay on our borrowings and other factors and is reviewed by the asset-liability committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. We primarily pay interest on our bank borrowings based on floating rates and on our NCDs and borrowings from the NHB based on fixed and floating rates. As our RPLR is reviewed on a quarterly basis, it allows us the ability to pass on increases in our borrowing costs to our customers, which we have been able to do in the past. For example, we increased our RPLR in FY2021, FY2022, FY2023 and the nine months ended December 31, 2023, which contributed to the increase in our interest income for those periods (for further details, see \"\u2013 Our Results of Operations\" below). As a result, we have been able to improve our net interest margin, which amounted to 5.8%, 6.9%, 8.0%, 8.0% and 9.0% for FY2021, FY2022, FY2023 and the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See \u201cSelected Statistical Information\u201d on page 215 for further details.\n\nWe increased our RPLR by 50 BPS during the month of October 2022 and 75 BPS in April 2023 to compensate for an increase in finance cost on borrowing in FY2023 and FY2024. This has resulted in an increase in our finance cost for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and an increase in our average cost of borrowings from 7.0% for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 to 7.6% for the nine months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition, we believe we also have in place effective asset liability management strategies and aim to ensure that we do not have any cumulative asset/ liability mismatches. In FY2021, FY2022 and FY2023 and the nine months ended December 31, 2023, we have positive asset-liability mismatch across all the maturity buckets. While the contracted maturity of the loans that we originate is higher than the maturity of our borrowings, the actual maturity of the loans is typically lower (due to prepayment and foreclosures).

In addition, interest on non- convertible debentures increased by 5.0% to \u20b9 1,782.4 million for FY2023 from \u20b9 1,697.4 million for FY2022. The increase in interest on NDCs was due to increase in the outstanding balances of NCDs. These increases were partially offset by a lower average cost of borrowing, which decreased to 7.0% as of March 31, 2023, compared with 7.2% as of March 31, 2022. Our average total borrowing increased to \u20b9114,140.2 million as of March 31, 2023, compared with \u20b9 105,245.3 million as of March 31, 2022.\n\nImpairment on financial instruments. Our impairment on financial instruments increased by 1.0% to \u20b9492.1 million for FY2023 from \u20b9 487.1 million for FY2022, primarily due to an increase in bad-debts written off by 210.1% to \u20b9187.3 million for FY2023 from \u20b960.4 million for FY2022. For FY2023, provisions / write-offs in our portfolio of loans to developers for the year ended March 31, 2023, amounted to a gain of \u20b9 75.4 million, compared to a loss of \u20b9 209.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 due to recoveries in written off loans.\n\nEmployees benefits expense. Employees benefits expense increased by 29.7% to \u20b9 3,220.1 million for FY2023 from \u20b92,481.9 million for FY2022, primarily due to an increase in salaries, bonus and other allowances by 31.9% to \u20b92,878.7 million for FY2023 from \u20b92,182.9 million for FY2022. The increase in salaries, bonus and other allowances was due to an increase in the number of our employees for FY2023 compared with FY2022. Our on-roll employees increased to 3,663 as of March 31, 2023, as compared with 2,769 as of March 31, 2022. In FY2023, our company accrued a one-time special bonus of \u20b9250.0 million given to 353 employees in recognition of their contribution to our Company, after taking into account factors such as their criticality, performance and future delivery capability.

For FY2022, we had a current tax expense of \u20b91,254.5 million and a deferred tax expense of \u20b929.4 million. Increase in total tax expenses was on account of increase in profit before tax by 22.6% to \u20b9 6,958.2 million for FY2023 from \u20b9 5,673.6 million for FY2022.\n\nProfit for the period.

Our revenue from operations increased by 9.7% to \u20b9 17,282.7 million for FY2022 from \u20b9 15,753.3 million for FY2021, primarily due to an increase in interest income by 7.8%, to \u20b9 15,382.9 million for FY2022 from \u20b9 14,269.4 million for FY2021. The increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in our interest on loans, which increased by 12.3% to \u20b9 14,634.3 million from \u20b913,033.6 million. This increase was in line with the growth in our Retail AUM which increased to \u20b9 147,766.9 million as of March 31, 2022 from \u20b9 133,252.2 million as of March 31, 2021 primarily on account of housing and other property loan disbursements of \u20b9 39,919.3 million for FY2022 from \u20b9 35,447.1 million for FY2021 and an increase in the number of customers to 204,135 as of March 31, 2022 from 182,471 as of March 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in average yield of housing and other property loans to 12.8% in FY2022 from 13.2% in FY2021. This increase was partly offset by a reduction in interest on fixed deposits of 43.2% to \u20b9 689.0 million in FY2022 from \u20b9 1,212.1 million in FY2021, primarily due to a decrease in investment in fixed deposit with banks and decrease in average interest rates on fixed deposits during FY2022.\n\nFurther, net gain on derecognition of financial instruments under amortized cost category increased by 45.7% to \u20b9 929.6 million for FY2022 from \u20b9638.1 million for FY2021.

Additionally, net gain on fair value changes increased by 167.2% to \u20b9 234.6 million for FY2022 from \u20b9 87.8 million for FY2021 primarily due to an increase in realized investments, as a result of increase in investment made in liquid and overnight mutual fund.\n\nOther income.

For such borrowings, we enter into debenture trust deeds (\u201cDTDs\u201d) and, in terms of such DTDs, a specified interest or coupon rate is to be paid per annum. The interest rate for the NCDs issued by our Company ranges from 6.9% to 10.0% per annum.\n\n2.\n\nSecurity: In terms of our borrowings where security needs to be created, we are typically required to create security primarily by way of first hypothecation or pari passu charge, on our Company\u2019s book debts, receivables, current assets, investments, cash and bank balances, as the case maybe. There may be additional requirements for creation of security under the various borrowing arrangements entered into by us.\n\n3.\n\nPrepayment: We have the option to prepay the lenders, subject to payment of prepayment charges at such rate as may be stipulated by the lenders which typically ranges up to 2% of the amount prepaid. Further, some loans may be prepaid without any prepayment charges subject to the fulfilment of conditions, including by providing prior notice to the lender. In relation to the NCDs, if the Company is required to redeem the NCDs prior to the expiry of redemption period, it is required to obtain all necessary approvals under applicable laws, including but not limited to, written approval from the RBI, in relation to such early redemption.\n\n4.\n\nRe-payment: The cash credit facilities are typically repayable on demand. The repayment period for most term loans and NHB sanctioned refinance typically ranges from four to 16 years and five to 15 years, respectively. We are required to repay the amounts in such instalments as per the repayment schedule stipulated in the relevant loan documentation.

Considering the time required for making necessary changes to the systems and to ensure complete and smooth transition to the UPI payment mechanism, the UPI Circulars have introduced the UPI Mechanism in three phases in the following manner:\n\nPhase I: This phase was applicable from January 1, 2019 until March 31, 2019 or floating of five main board public issues, whichever was later. Subsequently, the timeline for implementation of Phase I was extended till June 30, 2019. Under this phase, an RIB had the option to submit the ASBA Form with any of the Designated Intermediary and use his/ her UPI ID for the purpose of blocking of funds. The time duration from public issue closure to listing continued to be six Working Days.\n\nPhase II: This phase has become applicable from July 1, 2019. and was to initially continue for a period of three months or floating of five main board public issues, whichever is later.

Foreign investment is permitted (except in the prohibited sectors) in Indian companies, either through the automatic route or the approval route, depending upon the sector in which foreign investment is sought to be made. The Government of India makes policy announcements on FDI through press notes and press releases. The regulatory framework, over a period of time, thus, consists of acts, regulations, press notes, press releases, and clarifications among other amendments. Further, the FDI Policy issued by the DPIIT consolidates and supersedes all previous press notes, press releases and clarifications on FDI issued by the DPIIT that were in force and effect prior to October 15, 2020.\n\nIn terms of Press Note 3 of 2020, dated April 17, 2020 (\u201cPress Note\u201d), issued by the DPIIT, the FDI Policy and the FEMA Rules has been amended to state that all investments under the foreign direct investment route by entities of a country which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country will require prior approval of the Government of India. Further, in the event of transfer of ownership of any existing or future foreign direct investment in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the aforesaid restriction/ purview, such subsequent change in the beneficial ownership will also require approval of the Government of India. Pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) (Fourth Amendment) Rules, 2020, a multilateral bank or fund, of which India is a member, shall not be treated as an entity of a particular country nor shall any country be treated as the beneficial owner of the investments of such bank of fund in India.
